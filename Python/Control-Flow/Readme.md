## Control Flow

#### Boolean Expression 

- A boolean expression is a statement that can either be true or false 

#### Relational Operator 

- Relational operators compare 2 values and return True or False based on the operands 
- Logical Operators are used to combine multiple Boolean Expressions
- The equals-to operator(==) returns True if both the operands are the same otherwise it returns False
- The not equals to operator (!=) is the negation of the equals to operator .The Boolean expression a!=b will return True if the values a and b are different otherwise it will return False

#### Boolean Variables 

-   True or False are the only bool types and any variable that is assigned one of these values is called a boolean variable 
- Boolean variables can be created in several ways .The easiest way is to simply assign True or False to a variable 
- we can alao set a variable equal to a boolean expression
