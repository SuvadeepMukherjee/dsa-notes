## Hello World

#### Comments 

Python interprets anything after a # as a comment 

#### Print 

The print() function is used to tell a computer to talk .The message to be printed should be surrounded by quotes

```python
print("There is something at work in my soul, which I do not understand.")
```

#### String 

In python a string is either surrounded by double quotes ("Hello World") or ('Hello World')

#### Variables

In python we assign variables by using the equals sign . Variables cant have spaces or symbols in their names othen than an underscore(_) . They cant begin with numbers but they can have numbers after the first letter

#### Errors

Two common errors that we encounter while writing python are SyntaxError and NameError 

- Syntax Error means there is something wrong with the way our program is written- punctuation that does not belong , a command where it is not expected or a missing parethesis can all trigger a syntax error
- Name Error - a name error occurs when the python interpreter sees a word it does not recognize.Code that contains something that looks like a variable but was never identified will throw a namerror
